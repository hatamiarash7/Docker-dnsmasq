# Docker dnsmasq

Deploy [dnsmasq](https://thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html) with a simple web UI using Docker.

## How-to

Prepare your `dnsmasq.conf`

```conf
# Log all dns queries
log-queries

# Don't use hosts nameservers
no-resolv

# Use cloudflare as default nameservers
server=1.0.0.1
server=1.1.1.1
strict-order

# Serve all .company queries using a specific nameserver
server=/company/10.0.0.1

# Or explicitly define host-ip mappings
address=/myhost.company/10.0.0.2
address=/myhost2.company/10.0.0.3
```

## Run

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## Usage

- Open <http://localhost:8080> to see web UI
- If the `53` port is busy with other services like `systemd`, you should stop them.
- Use your Docker's host ip to set your DNS server on other devices in your network
- You can use your `/etc/hosts` file as a volume. dnsmasq will respect that.
